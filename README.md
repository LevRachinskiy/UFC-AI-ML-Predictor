# UFC-AI-ML-Predictor
Looking to predict the outcome of UFC fights using machine learning. This project uses a neural network trained on historical UFC fight data to estimate the probability that Fighter A will win a given matchup.

Baseline Guess: 50% 

Version 1 (4 feature neural network): 67% accuracy when using betting odds from other betting sources and simple physical traits (Height, Age, etc)

Phase 2: If we identify a "wrestler" type of fighter based on details, picking this archtype alone wins at a 60% rate.

Next Phase: Teach model to find heavy wrestler vs striker match ups, with proper improvements I think this type of match up can get to a consistent 75%+ prediction accuracy, and model will choose these fights by itself.
